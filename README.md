## Single Page Netlify, Jekyll and Github Pages

This is is intended to be deployed on Netlify and Github pages as your user page as a portfolio.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/rhildred/netlify-jekyll-github-pages)

There are 4 levers that you can use to make this your own.

1. You can put your own (s)css code in [assets/css/style.scss](assets/css/style.scss)
1. You can modify the html in [_layouts/default.html](_layouts/default.html)
1. You can add static bookmarklets that will be at the bottom of your single page sheet following the example of [about.md](about.md)
1. You can add fields to your posts by editing [admin/config.yml](admin/config.yml)

I will be providing more detail on each option in the following.
